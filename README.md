This project primarily features a blogpost with the use of a custom javascript element (accordion), serving as a proof of concept of blogposts or information posts in general where elaboration can be hidden or expanded based on the curiousity of the reader.

## Motivation
Information in today's age is in abundance, but while technology has made information more *accessible*, current methods of information display are not flexible enough to cater to various audience members' needs. 

In creating this project, I envisioned that any information post in the future could be presented both in summary (almost akin to a tweet, or a TL;DR), as well as in its fully elaborated form. This would allow for readers who wish only to obtain the key points to quickly glance them, and for readers who which to delve deeper to understand the intricacies of the issue to further explore the topic.

While the proof of concept presented here is in the form of an article, I foresee other uses, for example in critical literary analysis (starting out with the critique, where the setences can be expanded to show the relevant quotes, or starting out with the main text, expanding the lines to show analysis of that particular line or scene), policy debate (much like this article), or alongside design specifications.
