          Human progression was never straightforward and linear. Variations, tweaks,
          and subtleties have to be introduced into the status quo, withstand the test
          of time and societal norms, before it can hope to be widely adopted.
          Cryptocurrency is just another one of society’s experiments; It is therefore

        <h1>Convenience, Mother of Currency</h1>

        <p>To understand Cryptocurrency, we first seek to understand the motivating
          factors for the development of fiat currency.
          <br /><br />
          Consider Alice and Bob.
          <br /><br />
          In simpler days, if Alice and her tribe wanted to survive together in the
          wild, the easiest manner by which to do so would be to work together and
          share the benefits over an evening bonfire. This, though grossly simplified,
          is an idea propagated by Karl Marx and Communism.
          <br /><br />
          As society developed and means of travel became more sophisticated,
          communities based in different locations became more interconnected. Bartering
          evolved as a result for both communities to benefit from their produce at
          home. Alice, could trade her apples for Bob’s fish, at a mutually agreed
          ratio.
          <br /><br />
          Yet, bartering was insufficient as a means of trading. If Alice wanted Bob’s
          fish in the winter, where Bob has difficulties catching due to the weather,
          or Bob had wanted Alice’s apples in the summer, where the trees were not
          yet fully grown, neither trade would have been possible. In economic terms,
          this was known as the problem of the Double Coincidence of Wants.
          <br /><br />
          To deal with this situation, Alice would trade her apples for Charlie’s
          bushels of wheat at a mutually agreed ratio. With the wheat now acting as
          an intermediate buffer, Alice is now able to obtain Bob’s fishes in the
          other seasons, and vice versa. Inadvertently, Alice, Bob, and Charlie would
          have fuelled modern monetary economic’s three functions of money:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Medium of Exchange (Charlie’s wheat)</li>
          <li>Units of Account (by determining the ratio for trade)</li>
          <li>Storage of Value (using Charlie’s wheat to overcome the coincidence of wants)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Early choices of commodity money would often be livestock or produce, but
          these choices were often perishable, decreasing their function as a storage
          of value. Oxen could fall ill and die, while produce goes bad eventually.
          <br /><br />
          In comes Dion, who, while stumbling in caves one day, found precious metals.
          These precious metals became the next step forward in creating money, because
          they were non-perishable, hard to obtain, and divisible. If you traded in
          terms of oxen, how do you buy half an oxen worth of items? By measuring the
          weight of metals, they could be divided accordingly for the purchase of an
          item. Central authorities started grabbing onto this idea, and forged them
          into common denominations to further increase the convenience. Coinage could
          be traced back to roughly 900 B.C. in Sparta or about 600 B.C in Greece.
          <br /><br />
          While usage of metal was assuredly more convenient than oxen and wheat, as
          society progressed and started producing items and services of a greater
          value, it became necessary to innovate to avoid having to lug huge amounts
          of metal for large purchases. Paper notes became the next step forward, and
          are largely what we use today.
          <br /><br />
          But if there’s one thing that defines all humans, it’s laziness. While
          traditional money worked well for purchases, Alice and friends started
          wondering if there was any way to make it better in scenarios where transactions
          have to be made frequently.
          <br /><br />
          Instead of having the money swap hands all the time, they started keep a
          record of all the transactions. Now, when Dion buys an apple from Alice
          for 1 dollar, the record will record it as ‘Dion pays Alice 1 dollar’. At
          the end of every month, all of them will come together and review the
          record. If they have a negative balance, they contribute into the pot. If
          they have a positive balance, they withdraw from the pot. Due to the zero-sum n
          ature of the record ledger, the system is guaranteed to work, if everybody
          follows the rules.
          <br /><br />
          But there always will be

        <h1>Distrust, Father of Currency</h1>
        <p>Convenience developed the forms of currency thus far, but increased convenience
          provides increased ease of greed. Distrust, therefore, comes into play to
          drive the development of currency.
          <br /><br />
          Take the ledger system we have developed previously for example. The credit
          card is an example of a modern day ledger system - every transaction you
          make is first paid by the creditor (i.e. your bank), and at the end of every
          month you pay your bills. The bank keeps a running ledger for us, and we
          place our trust in them to not abuse this authority.
          <br /><br />
          Two points of failure exist in such a system. Firstly, the user. Credit
          card systems rely on the user maintaining the privacy of his or her credit
          card details. While hard, if another person is capable of stealing the credit
          card details, then the account is permanently compromised.
          <br /><br />
          Secondly, the banks themselves. For the layperson the purpose of banks seem
          to just be providing a safe area to store our funds. Yet banks, and to a
          greater extent fiat currency, are as much political constructs as they are
          economic constructs. They provide an avenue for which policymakers and
          financial institutions may affect policies to manipulate and regulate
          expenditure. The details are sufficiently long to warrant an article by
          themselves, but interested readers can find out more here, here, here, and
          here.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>With Great Power comes Great Responsibility</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Cliched as it may be, if the polices put in place are ineffective, then the
          common population suffers from the repercussions. In the 20th century, this
          happened in many countries, such as Yugoslavia, Germany, and Hungary, where
          actions of a central authority was pinned with the blame of causing the
          episodes, each with serious ramifications.
          <br /><br />
          Referencing the above situations, calls for decentralisation of currency
          have been made. Notably, such a move has to be done in the digital realm,
          which presents itself as the only feasible avenue through which it is
          possible there will not be any one particular entity controlling and issuing
          the currency.
          <br /><br />
          Several procedural questions have to be answered before effective decentralisation
          can occur.
          <ol>
            <li>Given that it is likely through digital means, how do we ensure the
              privacy of the users (i.e. not require or reveal more information of
              the user than necessary)?</li>
            <li>Clearly, if the move to decentralisation was done to avoid needing to
              trust any one entity in particular, how do we keep track of transactions?</li>
            <li>If there are any conflicts, how do we address them?</li>
            <li>How do we avoid fraud?</li>
          </ol>
          Cryptocurrency sought to answer the above questions.

        <h1>Creation of Bitcoin</h1>
        <p>In 2009, an unknown programmer Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a solution to the
          above. The simplified protocol functions in four steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Set-up.</strong> Each user in the system has a public key and a private key.
              They also keep track of every transaction that has taken place, much
              alike a ‘ledger’.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction.</strong> Every potential transaction is authorised by the payer
              by the private key, and this authorisation is verifiable with knowledge
              of only the public key.</li>
            <li><strong>Blockchain.</strong> Multiple unprocessed transactions are drawn, and a ‘miner’
              forms a block with them. The ‘miner’ then finds a string that fulfils
              certain criterias, and propagate the block on the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Conflict Resolution.</strong> If conflicting ‘ledgers’ are detected, then
              every user will keep track of every copy, and select the longest chain
              where possible.</li>
          </ol>
          <strong>1. Set-up</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Each user is given a public and private key pair through Elliptic Curve
            Cryptography methods, with the potential public/private key pairs numbering
            6.23 10^56. As an illustration of how great that number is, the fastest
            recorded supercomputer, Tianhe-2, is theoretically capable of running 55
            10^15 calculations per second. Assuming everyone in the world has a
            Tianhe-2, and were simultaneously attempting to crack your key pair, it
            would take about 10^23 years, which is still orders of magnitude higher
            than the estimated age of the universe. This means that it is almost
            impossible for someone else to either 1) chance upon the pair randomly,
            or 2) guess the pair correctly.
            <br /><br />
            A secondary detail to note is that due to the complexity of the key pair,
            it is almost impossible to regain your key pair with no information
            whatsoever. If you happen to lose the key pair (e.g. due to transferring
            from one desktop to another), then all the currency in it is lost. A
            staggering 2.77 million Bitcoins are lost and permanently out of circulation.
            This is an important figure to note, because the Bitcoin algorithm only
            generates 21 million Bitcoins in its lifetime, so the above-mentioned amount
            accounts for more than 10% of the entire future Bitcoin economy.
          </p>
          <strong>2. Transaction</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Like a ledger system, Bitcoin will record down transactions made by its
            users, with authentication by the payer.
            <br /><br />
            Authentication over the digital realm is an interesting question. In an
            arena where all data can be represented by bits of ‘1’ and ‘0’s, how
            might we provide authentication in a meaningful manner without the risk
            of attackers stealing it?
            <br /><br />
            Cryptography comes to the rescue. In the study of cryptography we are
            exposed to functions which are easy to compute in one direction but not
            the other. An example is the computation of square roots. While it is
            easy to verify if the answer is correct (by multiplying it by itself),
            it is much harder to obtain the square root.
            <br /><br />
            Bitcoin uses an algorithm known as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
            Algorithm. While it is easy for the user to generate a signature with his
            private key and the transaction to be authenticated, it is difficult for
            an attacker to obtain the key from the signature. Furthermore, an advantage
            of this algorithm is that the signature can be verified with only knowledge
            of the transaction details and the public key, so the user’s private key
            is secret throughout.
          </p>
          <strong>3. Blockchain, Conflict Resolution, and Fraud Prevention</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Now that we have generated transactions, we need to figure out a protocol
            to add them into a digital ledger that allows us to address conflicts and
            prevent fraud.
            <br /><br />
            To do this, we draw inspiration from the days of commodity money.
            <br /><br />
            As previously mentioned, early commodity money was in the form of livestock
            and produce. Why was it that we were perfectly fine with people rearing
            more livestock or harvesting more produce but not when people tried to
            counterfeit notes? The answer, we suggest, is work.
            <br /><br />
            While it requires a lot of work from the user to rear livestock or plant
            more produce, counterfeiting money as a task possesses relatively less
            barriers. We were happy to award the farmers accordingly by letting them
            use the livestock or produce as money.
            <br /><br />
            Emulating that in a Cryptocurrency, and we have our solution to currency
            generation. Computationally intensive tasks were used since 1997, although
            back then it was known as Hashcash, and it was created to counter spammers
            by asking for partial hash collision.
            <br /><br />
            Partial hash collisions demanded a hash (encoded message, Hashcash uses
            the Secure Hash Algorithm-1, or SHA-1) that matches partially with another
            string. The reason why this worked was because SHA-1 produces a very
            different output even if the input changes a little. As an example, the
            empty string (line of characters) produces the following SHA-1 hash:
            <br /><br />
            da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709
            <br /><br />
            whereas the string ‘a’ produces the following SHA-1 hash:
            <br /><br />
            86f7e437faa5a7fce15d1ddcb9eaeaea377667b8
            <br /><br />
            Take for instance the string ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA’, which
            when encoded in SHA-1, produces:
            <br /><br />
            e04976c6e1ce44aa1840b07b57021c158a11eafc
            <br /><br />
            whereas the string ‘AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB’ produces:
            <br /><br />
            427b014d063769f93d018c7ed1336cd77edaf38d
            <br /><br />
            The output changes in a fashion which cannot be reliably predicted by
            computers or algorithms today, so the only way to determine the string
            from the hash is through pure guesswork. What hash collisions meant was
            that we wanted to find a string that when hashed, fulfils a certain
            criteria (normally, this criteria involves the first n digits of the
            results being ‘0’s). This string typically starts with the details of the
            message. An example taken from the Hashcash FAQ is, if the email address
            of the sender was adam@cypherspace.org, and the email was sent at 2003
            June 26th, then the computer will go through all possibilities to determine
            a string like this:
            <br /><br />
            0:030626:adam@cypherspace.org:6470e06d773e05a8
            <br /><br />
            Which, when encoded in SHA-1, gives us:
            <br /><br />
            00000000c70db7389f241b8f441fcf068aead3f0
            <br /><br />
            It is worth noting that we are capable of modifying the computational
            difficulty by specifying a different condition. For example, we could
            require the system to match the first 12 digits to be 0s. Each additional
            digit increases the difficulty (and therefore the time taken) by approximately
            16 times. Interestingly, while methods like these are use in encryption,
            there has been no rigouros proof that cracking (deriving the inverse
            function of) the Secure Hash Algorithm is impossible.
            <br /><br />
            Building on this idea, B-money and Reusable Proofs of Work (RPOW) by
            Wei Dai and Hal Finney respectively implemented a proof of work by
            requiring that the computers calculate a hash before the computer earn
            the money. While they came close to what Nakamoto proposed, they were
            scant on the details of implementing it within a context of a decentralised
            system, and RPOW in particular ended up relying on a trusted server at the
            back-end, causing a lack of true decentralisation.
            <br /><br />
            This was the reason why Bitcoin was thought of as revolutionary. It
            established a protocol which ensured that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Verification could be done by any user on the network.</li>
            <li>No trust on any one user or group was required.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The protocol works as follows:
            <br /><br />
            Firstly, unconfirmed transactions are gathered as a group into a block.
            <br /><br />
            Next, computers seek a string to append to the end of the block that
            allows the SHA-256 hash of the block to fulfil a partial hash collision.
            It is worth noting for Bitcoin that the partial hash collision is changed
            every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks), such that it takes approximately
            10 minutes for each block to be found. This is an important feature
            because of Moore’s Law suggesting that computing power doubles every two
            years, and Bitcoin is structured such that new Bitcoins enter the system
            in a orderly, predictable manner unperturbed by external factors.
            <br /><br />
            When a match is found, the computer that determines the string is given
            Bitcoins as reward, and propagates the block to the rest of the network.
            Due to the work involved in finding the match, these computers are known
            as ‘miners’. The appended string is then added to the header of the next
            block, which plays on the quality of SHA algorithms that even if the text
            is altered slightly, the resultant hash will change greatly. This links
            the history of all blocks together into what we call a ‘blockchain’.
            <br /><br />
            Due to varying reasons, it is entirely possible that miners may choose
            to work on different blocks, or that users are not kept up to date with
            the latest blocks. Bitcoin deals with this situation by trusting ‘work’,
            or in this case the longest blockchain. If two conflicting chains of the
            same length are detected, then the users will keep track of both blockchains
            until one of them is longer than the other by an adequate margin. As of
            writing, the Bitcoin community has decided on 6 as this magic number, meaning
            that a transaction is really only considered through if it is in the current
            blockchain, and there are 6 blocks after it.
            <br /><br />
            Now, let us consider what might need to happen if, say, Ephraem, decides
            to want to cheat Alice by double spending money.
            <br /><br />
            For this to work, Ephraem will make a transaction to Alice, wait until
            Alice accepts the transaction as valid, then subsequently injecting a
            longer valid block chain. As the community is dependent on the proof of
            work, if Ephraem can pull this off, he will technically be able to ‘erase’
            his transaction with Alice.
            <br /><br />
            From the above, for Ephraem to do this, he has to come up with a consecutive
            chain of 6 blocks by himself, faster than the rest of the world working
            on it. While he may get lucky the first or even the second time, it is
            neigh impossible to replicate the efforts 6 times.
            <br /><br />
            Note, however that the above assumes that Ephraem is working alone. In
            reality, miners usually work together in a group, known as a ‘mining
            guild’. Each miner contributes computing power, and any Bitcoin earned
            is shared amongst everyone in the guild, which allows for more reliable
            returns on mining. BTC Guild, currently the largest Bitcoin mining guild,
            has obtained 6 consecutive blocks in a row multiple times. In other words,
            there is the potential that a group of people determined enough may spoil
            the Bitcoin market in this fashion.

          <h1>Taking Stock</h1>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Before moving on, it is essential that we achieve a holistic view of
            Cryptocurrency by examining their potential socio-economical impacts.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>1. Mobility of Money</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Cryptocurrency can be easily transferred between two willing parties if
            both users run the same code and adhere to the same protocol. The lack of
            a middleman in such a scenario therefore reduces transaction fees, and
            its digital implementation increases the mobility of money.
            <br /><br />
            On the positive side, this increased mobility of money carries the potential
            of alleviating poverty. In Argentina, Bitcoin was portrayed to “offer a
            safe haven” from rapidly depreciating government peso. Research has shown
            that micro-credit provides a repeatedly proven method to help families
            escape the poverty cycle. Venezuelan citizens have also turned to using
            cryptocurrency mining as a means of combating hyperinflation.
            <br /><br />
            Yet, mobility of money is neutral and may be easily abused. Silk Road,
            a darknet market for illegal drugs, conducts all its transactions via
            Bitcoin, offering its users privacy to escape the long arm of the law.
            Nearly 300,000 Bitcoins (approximately 3.12 trillion USD) were seized,
            and Bitcoin experienced a drop of nearly 25% in terms of USD/Bitcoin
            exchange rates when the news was announced.
            <br /><br />
            A visceral response for policymakers might be to impose a strict ban on
            Cryptocurrencies, but such an approach might not be viable for many reasons.
            Firstly, with the widespread adoption of Cryptocurrencies at the present,
            and the peer-to-peer nature of implementation, it is almost impossible to
            impose a blanket ban. Consider as analogy the laws against content piracy
            via torrents. Legal authorities face huge difficulties in tracking down
            users torrenting copyrighted materials, and are therefore unable to execute
            the laws in a meaningful manner. Like Cryptocurrencies, the act of torrenting
            itself is not illegal, but the potential for abuse is present and should
            be discouraged.
            <br /><br />
            To do so, policymakers may consider turning their attention to the entry
            and exit ramps, where Cryptocurrencies are exchanged for fiat currencies.
            Not only do these ramps serve as chokepoints for legal authorities to focus
            their efforts on, it seems likely that regulation, rather than a strict ban
            will allow for communities to harness the benefits that Cryptocurrencies
            provide.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>2. Privacy and Vulnerability</strong>
            <br /><br />
            In theory, Cryptocurrency users need not reveal any personal information
            to operate in a network.
            <br /><br />
            In practice, however, there are many avenues through which a user’s public
            address and his or her identity can be linked. A 2012 research concluded
            that various strategies were capable of identifying up to 60% of Bitcoin
            users of the MyBitcoin service. Vulnerabilities exist both in the network
            (through identifying and tracing transactions) and out of the network
            (posting public keys on forums, IP addresses, geographical information,
            etc) which when combined would offer the potential of unmasking the
            identity of a user.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, while Cryptocurrencies were developed such that no trust
            needs to be placed in human agencies, people end up placing their faith
            in various entities such as online wallet services. People would then pay
            for it when MyBitcoin shut down, resulting in losses of 154,406 Bitcoins,
            or when Mt. Gox lost 744,408 Bitcoins in a hack. The huge financial
            incentives for attackers, alongside immature security technology, makes
            Bitcoin exchanges a tempting target.
            <br /><br />
            Users of current Cryptocurrency networks are therefore cautioned: Though
            the network itself may be relatively private and self-secure, the logistics
            involved in operating in the network may result in opening up a different
            can of worms. Expectations should therefore be managed accordingly.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>3. Tax Evasion</strong>
            <br /><br />
            While the Bitcoin white paper was only published in 2009, the creation of
            a digital currency was predicted back in 1999 by Nobel Laureate Milton
            Friedman. One of the incentives he noted was tax evasion - when trades
            happened behind the veil of cryptography, the government has a harder time
            imposing the appropriate taxes. Cryptocurrency provides great financial
            incentive to adopt as a platform, functioning as a tax haven.
            <br /><br />
            However, taxes were created as a means to fund public goods and services.
            Left alone, it is suspected that public infrastructure will be inflicted
            with the tragedy of the commons, where individuals working to their benefit
            behave in a manner counterproductive to the benefit of the collective society.
            How societies attempt to answer this question will lead to whether or not
            Cryptocurrencies can be sustainably adopted as the de facto currency in the
            long term.
            <br /><br />
            Nevertheless, the transitional period where global citizens attempt the
            move before figuring out the answers may be dangerous. Modern laws have
            not sufficiently evolved to expect and address such a payment method, and
            now find themselves in a race against the clock to figure out the proper
            path ahead.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>4. Adoption as a Global Currency</strong>
            <br /><br />
            If money serves to act as an intermediary to facilitate transactions, why
            not extend its effectiveness by creating a global currency, one that is
            not bounded by politics or society? This question is multi-faceted, and
            can only be insufficiently explored in this essay.
            <br /><br />
            Various economic and monetary unions have been explored and used in the
            past and present, the most well-recognised examples are the Euro and the
            US Dollar. The formation of economic and monetary unions have also been
            explored by economists in the past, with one of the more well-known works
            being Mundell’s theory on Optimum Currency Areas, further developed by
            Kenen and McKinnon. Optimum Currency Areas argue that a successful currency
            union requires four criteria: Labour mobility, Capital mobility, Risk-sharing
            system, and Common business cycles.
            <br /><br />
            The 2009 European Sovereign Debt Crisis highlighted the importance of
            some of these criteria. Originally, the European Monetary Union enacted
            a clause that called for a no-bailout policy, intended to ensure that
            the growth of countries in the union will not be dragged down by other
            countries. In 2010, however, the European committee realised that this
            was unfeasible, and abandoned the clause. In contrast, mechanisms are in
            place to allow the Federal Government of the United States to provide
            fiscal transfers to states as a stabilising measure, allowing for shock
            absorption and greater sustainability.
            <br /><br />
            It is unclear, in the hands of a currency unmanaged by any central
            authority, how economic shocks will play out. Will regional boundaries
            matter? Will concepts like ‘country’ increase or diminish in significance?
            <br /><br />
            <strong>5. Usage of non-fiat currencies</strong>
            <br /><br />
            Intentionally or not, the world has already seen attempts to introduce
            money outside fiat currencies. In jail cells it is common to see cigarettes
            or ramen used as money for other objects; Tide detergent bottles were noted
            to have been used by drug dealers. These currencies see localised usage as
            a method to circumvent current existing rules and regulations.
            <br /><br />
            In online games we also see the introduction of currencies. These monetary
            systems are constructs meant to facilitate the game’s economy, as another
            ends for players to work towards. Yet, in recent times it has been noted
            that these virtual currencies could also be treated as an alternate currency.
            While often small in impact, Second Life (which was registered to have a
            million active users per month) and its in-game currency Linden Dollars
            have came under scrutiny. A 2012 European Central Bank report was
            published to analyse the potential price and financial stability impacts
            virtual currencies had on real currencies. Conclusions were drawn that at
            the point in time of writing, virtual currency schemes were limited in
            impact, provided that the scope and adoption were continued to be limited.
            Optimistically, the report even predicted that such schemes would increase
            financial innovation and provide users with greater convenience. In 2015
            another report was published, finding that risks are entailed when dealing
            with these systems, but otherwise sees no need to provide modifications to
            the current legal framework.
            <br /><br />
            On the other hand, Tencent’s QQ-coins (alternatively named Q-coins) were
            judged by China’s central government to be potentially destabilising on
            the central currency. In contrast to Linden Dollars, QQ-coins were introduced
            as an acceptable payment method for auctions on Taobao.com, and were noted
            to have been involved in cases where gamblers attempted to circumvent the
            country’s strict anti-gambling laws.
            <br /><br />
            With their adoption becoming more commonplace, the currency substitution
            effect of Cryptocurrencies can not be neglected. An increasing lean towards
            such payment methods will see a reduction in central banks’ ability to
            influence short-term interest rates, which limits measures to encourage or
            discourage growth based on a country’s position. Furthermore, the relationship
            between a country’s fiat currency and monetary aggregates, which confounds
            risks to price stability.
            <br /><br />
            It can be argued that this was the ultimate aim for Cryptocurrencies: a
            decentralisation of financial power which ultimately meant that central
            banks and authorities have less power to control such situations. It has
            to be remembered, however, that the world has yet to see a large-scale
            substitution on a global level, and how situations play out in the interim
            is not yet known.
            <br /><br />
            Nevertheless, we observe that its openness
